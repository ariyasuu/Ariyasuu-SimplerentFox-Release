# Ariyasuu-SimplerentFox-Release
The custom userStyle I use, uploaded it here to share to those who might want it.
Used [SimplerentFox](https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/SimplerentFox) by [MiguelRAvila](https://github.com/MiguelRAvila) as my template and edited it to properly suit my needs!


Important stuff you might do for this theme to work properly:
Enable the use of custom styles in ```about:config```
```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets > True```
and enable the blurry URL bar

```layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled > true```

```gfx.webrender.all > true```

^ Both needed
