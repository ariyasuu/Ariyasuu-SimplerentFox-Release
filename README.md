# Ariyasuu-SimplerentFox-Release
The custom userStyle I use, uploaded it here to share to those who might want it.
Used [SimplerentFox](https://github.com/MiguelRAvila/SimplerentFox) by [MiguelRAvila](https://github.com/MiguelRAvila) as my template and edited it to properly suit my needs!
How to install the theme:
Type ```about:config``` on your URLBar then hit enter, accept the risk and search for 
```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets```, ```layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled``` and ```gfx.webrender.all``` and change them to ```True```

After that create a string called ```ui.prefersReducedMotion``` and set it to a value of ```1```
